    "Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability and their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 .Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency because it gives an idea of where the data is clustered. However, it can be affected by outliers, and is not always the best measure of central tendency when the data is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. The median is a useful measure of central tendency because it is less affected by outliers than the mean. It is also a good measure of central tendency when the data is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the most common value in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the data has a clear peak or is bimodal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability because it gives an idea of how spread out the data is. However, it can be affected by outliers and is not always the best measure of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean. The variance is a useful measure of variability because it gives an idea of how spread out the data is, and is not affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a useful measure of variability because it gives an idea of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean in terms of standard units. It is also commonly used to define confidence intervals and to test hypotheses in statistical analysis.\n",
